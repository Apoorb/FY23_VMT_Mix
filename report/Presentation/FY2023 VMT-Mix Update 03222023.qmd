## Outline

-   FY23 VMT-Mix Update

    -   Updated Python package structure and documentation

    -   Methodology Changes w.r.t FY22 VMT-Mix (Used for Trends)

    -   Distribution Changes w.r.t FY22 VMT-Mix (Used for Trends)

    -   Potential Reason for changes in VMT-Mix

-   Impact of VMT-Mix on Emission Inventories (EIs) On-road/ running Emissions:

    -   Statewide for Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs)

    -   Non-attainment counties w.r.t applicable CAPs
    
    -   Sensitivity of EIs to VMT-Mix

# FY23 VMT-Mix Update

## Updated Python package structure and documentation

Changes:

-   Added numpy docstring to all function and classes in the package.

-   Added readme to provide an overview of the modules.

-   Created Sphinx documentation for the module. It's available here: <https://apoorb.github.io/FY23_VMT_Mix>.

Reasons:

-   Future proofs the VMT-Mix development.

-   Allows other team members to be able to pick-up the VMT-Mix development in the future.

## Methodology Changes

The following updates are made to the FY23 VMT-Mix:

1.  Duplicate stations were removed from the vehicle classification counts.

    -   Vehicle classification count had data both by direction and location. Created checks to only use one.
    
2.  Directly using the counts, instead of converting them to annual counts first.

    -   The process was adding unnecessary complexity to the methodology.
    
3.  Also using data for 2020 and 2021. FY22 VMT-Mix only uses 2013 to 2019 data.

    -   Incorporated the VCC data from the most recent years.
    
    -   Waiting for the 2022 VCC data, which likely would be available in July 2023.

## Changes w.r.t FY22 VMT-Mix (Used for Trends)

-   Which counties see a lot of change: is the starting value quite small?

-   Figure 1: Range of change for PC

-   Figure 2: Range of change for 62, 61

-   Are other SUTs+FTs even important?

## FY23 VMT-Mix vs. FY22 Ozone Non-Attainment Area NOx EI

This table shows the absolute NOx emissions. The difference and percent difference in the next slides are w.r.t to these values. Thing to note for next slide is that even if **counties such as Waller and Liberty have around 10% change**, this likely **will not affect conformity** as their **total emissions are much lower.**

## FY23 VMT-Mix vs. Pre-FY21 VMT-Mix Ozone Non-Attainment Area NOx EI Impact

Bexar (AACOG) has a ~7.4% increase, Tarrant (NCTCOG) has ~3.4%, and Dallas has ~0.25% increase. All other counties have no change or a reduction.

## FY23 VMT-Mix vs. Pre-FY21 VMT-Mix PM10 Non-Attainment Area EI Impact

-   El Paso county is the only county currently (March 2023) that is in non-conformity for PM10.

-   The total PM10 running emissions for El Paso based on FY22 VMT-Mix is 1.13 short-tons/day.

-   The emission decrease by 0.03 short-tons/day; a ~2.9% decrease.
